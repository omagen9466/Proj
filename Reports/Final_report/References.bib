abstract = {This note provides a conceptually simple derivation of the Kelvin equation, based on the principles of hydrostatics, rather than the more elegant and abstract thermodynamic approach of equating the chemical potential of each of the phases. With the new derivation, the physical picture of a drop in equilibrium with its own vapour is more readily appreciated, and hence the basis of the Kelvin equation more easily understood by those less skilled in the science of thermodynamics. In turn, a number of the potential limitations [Powles, 1985. Journal of Physics A Mathematical and General 18, 1551–1560] of the Kelvin equation become physically obvious, notably the assumption that the liquid is incompressible, the vapour is an ideal gas, and the interfacial tension is independent of the curvature of the interface. In turn, appropriate corrections can easily be introduced as required.}

abstract = {Flashing flow is an important phenomenon in many industrial contexts; however simulation of these flows remains difficult. CFD simulations are able to describe the distribution and evolution of 3D structures in the flow but are dependent on good closure relations for interphase transfer. Nucleation during flashing flow is often neglected in CFD simulation where a minimum starting vapour fraction and a constant bubble number density are given. Models that include nucleation have used wall nucleation terms from 1D system code models, averaged over the domain. In this work, three models for wall nucleation are tested and compared with experimental data from a converging–diverging nozzle. Nucleation is applied at the walls of the domain, and various models are investigated. Good agreement with the critical flow rate and axial profiles are found, but agreement with the radial void fraction data is not satisfactory. Methods of addressing this are explored, and it is found that including a small bulk heterogeneous nucleation term gives the best agreement with the radial profiles, with negligible impact on the axial average properties.}

abstract = {Long-term sustainability of dropwise condensation (DWC) on treated surfaces is a key point for the exploitation of this heat transfer mechanism in industrial applications. A viable solution to achieve DWC, consisting of hybrid organic-inorganic sol-gel silica coatings containing hydrophobic moieties (methyl or phenyl group) is here presented. Different sol-gel coatings for DWC promotion were tested during condensation of steam in saturated conditions exhibiting heat transfer coefficient (HTC) around 100 kW m−2 K−1 in the heat flux range 100–500 kW m−2. Endurance tests have been performed at 400 kW m−2; an optimized sol-gel coating deposited on an aluminum substrate is shown to sustain DWC for more than 100 h without transition to filmwise condensation (FWC), which is an excellent result among those achieved on aluminum substrates. A comparison between the different coatings is done by surface characterization (contact angles measurements and Scanning Electron Microscopy) performed before and after condensation tests. Video analyses are carried out looking at droplet departing radius, droplets population and surface time renewal using a home-made software to detect the dimensions of the droplets. The present data are used to assess the expression proposed by Le Fevre and Rose (1966) for the droplet population, the equation by Kim and Kim (2011) for the departing radius and the model proposed by Chavan et al. (2016) for the heat transfer coefficient.}

abstract = {A population balance model is used, for the case when no experimental data or theoretical formulae are available, to derive the drop size distribution of small drops which grow mainly by direct condensation. This is combined with the well-known size distribution for large drops which grow mainly by coalescence and with the growth rate of single drops to compute the heat flux during the process of dropwise condensation. The computation can be simplified by neglecting all the relatively unimportant resistances except the resistance to heat conduction through the drop body. The vapor-side heat transfer coefficient of dropwise condensation can be estimated sufficiently accurately by the simple equation where re is half the mean spacing between the active nucleation sites on the substrate surface and rmax is the maximum drop radius. A method of computing the drop nucleation rate that is independent of the classical approach is also presented; the heat flux can be estimated from the nucleation rate.}
